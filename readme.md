# Vaccine Registration System (C Project)

This repository contains our **Introduction to Computer Science Project** implemented in **C programming language**.  
The project is a console-based **Vaccine Registration System** designed to store and manage user vaccination details through a structured menu-driven interface.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The system allows users to:
- Register individuals for vaccination
- Store user details (Name, Age, Gender, Aadhar Number, etc.)
- Check registration records
- Update or delete stored entries
- Manage vaccine allocation using file handling concepts

📌 This project demonstrates the use of:
- Functions
- Arrays & Structures
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- File Handling (read/write operations)
- Basic data validation
